# What this is and what it isnt
This was a fun exploration project on the inner workings of Neural Networks. It successfully solves the XOR Problem but on anything more complicated like MNIST it seems to completely fail. For anyone interested in building their own Neural Network, check this out. But dont expect to make much use of it.
